### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I am unfamiliar with CSS so I ran into some styling issues with the layout of the page that took me a while to figure out. Luckily there are a lot of online sources that help explain CSS styling so I was able to style my webpage appropriately.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would add the trailer on click functionality as I feel it would be extremely beneficial to the user. I would likely also add the description feature to each movie card so the user can access a quick overview of each film. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

We did not do demos this week.
